## About

- Our project will focus on analyzing sleep quality by evaluating factors such as stress levels, blood pressure, and BMI ratings using machine learning and other advanced technologies weâ€™ve studied. The model will be displayed on a user-interactive website, where the user can input their own data for personalized sleep quality assessment.

- The main goal of this project is to mark the importance of sleep and its array of effects on the human body's physical and mental health. To do this, we have provided various information regarding the topic, data visualizations based on a recorded dataset with Tableau, and tried creating different machine learning models (logistic regression, k-neighbors, random forest) to best predict sleep disorders based on various factors.

- Proper sleep is core to the growth and overall well-being of the human body and mind, we hope to spread awareness about its values and encourage those to take greater care of their health routine.
