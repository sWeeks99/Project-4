## About
*  <ins>Overview</ins>:<br></ins>
            Our project will focus on analyzing sleep quality by evaluating factors such as stress levels, blood pressure, and BMI ratings using machine learning and other advanced technologies weâ€™ve studied. The model will be displayed on a user-interactive website, where the user can input their own data for personalized sleep quality assessment.

*  <ins>Software and Language Used</ins>:<br></ins>
Python, HTML, CSS, Flask, SQL, Tableau

## Ethical Considerations
* This project was made for the purpose of a group experiment in creating a prediction model to detect sleep disorders based on several health and sleep related factors; it is in no way, shape, or form a certified method in sleep diagnostics. If you are concerned about your physical and mental health regarding sleep, please consult with primary care providers, not us.
